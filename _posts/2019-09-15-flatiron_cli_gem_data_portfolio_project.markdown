I have always been fascinated by the rapid rate in which the tech industry advances and by the manner in which these advancements contribute to the lives of so many individuals all over the world. When I sit back and think about how the tech industry advances every day, I can't help but to want to be part of the movement. For me, learning about software development was merely an obligation seeing as how the world will always continue to embrace technology and all of the great benefits that it provides to endless individuals. I have always been the type of person that likes to figure out the inner workings of things. I greatly enjoy learning about the mechanisms that exist behind the scenes of things as well as how exactly these mechanisms and their components work together to accomplish a specific task. When it comes to software, web applications, and the internet, I am no different. Ever since I started interacting with the internet and web applications, I have always been intrigued by the manner in which they are able to work. I have always been aware that someone had to develop these applications, but I always wondered about the way in which one goes about in doing so. This is exactly how I got into learning about software development. I must say that diving into software development was one of the best decisions that I have ever made. The software development field is without a doubt very broad. However, for a person like me that has no problem seeking answers and learning as much about a field this broad for the rest of  their life, I'd say it is as close to a perfect fit as it can get. Going through Flatiron School's software engineering program has only reassured me that software development is for me. Additionally, it has opened up the door to a whole new world that I find very intriguing and eager to learn about and because of this, I will be forever grateful for Flatiron School.
