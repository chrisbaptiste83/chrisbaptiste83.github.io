### Server Side Includes (SSI) is a simple interpreted server-side scripting language used almost exclusively for theweb.

#### The most frequent use of SSI is to include the contents of one or more files into a web page on a web server.

####  Server Side Includes are useful for including a common piece of code throughout a site, such as a page header, a page footer and a navigation menu. Conditional navigation menus can be conditionally included using control directives.

#### In order for a web server to recognize an SSI-enabled HTML file and therefore carry out these instructions, either the filename should end with a special extension, by default .shtml, .stm, .shtm, or, if server is configured to allow this, set the execution bit of the file.
